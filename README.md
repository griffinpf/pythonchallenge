# pythonchallenge
My experience working through pythonchallenge.com

- Solutions to each challenge are placed in the pythonchallenge url in order to open the next challenge page
  - http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/<solution goes here>.html
- URLs for each challenge are contained in comments at the beginning of each solution file
- If a challenge requires using another file, that file is located in the resources folder and is called from there by the solution
